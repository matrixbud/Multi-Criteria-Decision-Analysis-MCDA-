# Multi-Criteria-Decision-Analysis (MCDA)
I show that the current approach for ranking a set of candidates having multiple criteria does not work.
There is a vast literature based on finding and using weighting factors to determine the relative importance of the criteria. The simplest example of thisis the WEighted Sum Model (WSM), which is just the weighted sum equation using in probability to generate mean value.
I have developed a different approach. It is a simple set of equations that model the immportance and, more critically, the behavior of each criterion. The equations are utility functions, curves that represent how the decision maker views the contribution of each criterion to the overall goal. Each candidate has specific values for each criterion. The utility function equations are combined into a single equation that generates a single number for each candidate, called its total value. It is a rating that represents how well each candidate performs the desired task.
In this way, we avoid the use of relative weights for criteria. Rather, each criterion is represented by its own simple curve whose x-axis contains the range of values of the criterion and whose y-axis is a degradation factor that represents the criterion's contribution to the overall goal.
